      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>The Indonesian National Library was established by a 1980 ministerial decree of Education and Culture Minister Daoed Joesoef. Four libraries were consolidated in the process: two Department of Library Development Centre units (the Library of Political and Social History, created in 1952, and the Department of Bibliography and Deposits, created in 1953) the library of the Jakarta branch office of the Ministry of Education and Culture, created in 1953; and the library of the National Museum. In addition to the establishment of a national library system, the decree conferred legal deposit rights on the library. The library was brought under the purview of the Directorate General for Culture in the ministry.The new library was opened in 1988.</p>
